# Amazon-Clone

I have developed an Amazon clone using HTML and CSS, showcasing my skills in front-end web development. This project replicates the layout and design of the Amazon website, focusing on the user interface and visual elements. The clone includes a homepage with product listings, a navigation bar, and various sections similar to the original site, all crafted using pure HTML and CSS without any JavaScript or backend functionalities.
